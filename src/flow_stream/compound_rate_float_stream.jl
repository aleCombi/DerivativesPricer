    struct CompoundedRateStreamSchedules{D, A, B, N}

Defines a schedule of compounded rate streams. This structure holds information about payment dates, compounding schedules, and day counts for accrual periods in the context of financial instruments that apply compound interest rates.

# Fields
- `compounding_schedules::Vector{SimpleRateStreamSchedules{A,B}}`: A vector of simple rate stream schedules that determine the compounding intervals.
- `accrual_day_counts::Vector{N}`: A vector of total day counts for each compounding period, calculated from the `compounding_schedules`.

*Note*: The `pay_dates` field here only signifies scheduling purposes, without intrinsic meaning in the context of this struct.

Constructor for `CompoundedRateStreamSchedules`, which initializes an instance with specified `pay_dates` and `compounding_schedules`. The constructor computes `accrual_day_counts` by summing up day counts from each schedule in `compounding_schedules`.

# Arguments
- `compounding_schedules::Vector{SimpleRateStreamSchedules{A,B}}`: Vector of schedules representing compounding intervals for the rate stream.

# Returns
- An instance of `CompoundedRateStreamSchedules` with computed `accrual_day_counts`.
