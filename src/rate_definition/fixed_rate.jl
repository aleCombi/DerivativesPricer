    FixedRateConfig{D<:DayCount, R<:RateConvention} <: AbstractRateConfig

A concrete type representing a fixed rate configuration, parameterized by the day count convention `D`

# Fields
- `day_count_convention::D`: The day count convention used to calculate time fractions (e.g., 30/360, Actual/360).
- `rate_convention::R`: The rate convention, which defines whether rates are linear, continuously compounded, etc.
